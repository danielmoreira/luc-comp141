COMP 141 / 400D - Intro to Computing Tools and Techniques
Loyola University Chicago, Fall 2024
Assignment #2: File System Navigation and Exploration
Total: 10 points
Due date: Sep 22, 11:55 PM CT

1. Introduction
This document contains the instructions to answer
the second assignment of the COMP 141 / 400D course.
This assignment aims to train and evaluate the students'
abilities to navigate in a UNIX-like file system hierarchy
with the "cd" command, and collect file and directory
information by using commands such as "ls", and "file".


2. File System Preparation
If you are reading these instructions, it means you have
successfully executed the "git" command to clone the
"assignment_2" branch of the project hosted at
"https://github.com/danielmoreira/luc-comp141" to your
local Unix-like system. FYI, we will learn Git toward the
end of the course.

It also means you have found the cloned directory named
"assignment_2" within your file system. Make sure to have
it set as your current working directory by using the
"change directory" (cd) command to reach it. Use the
"print working directory" (pwd) command to confirm this
information.

Once inside the "assignment_2" directory, run the following
sequence of commands to prepare your file system for the
assignment. FYI, we will learn the meaning of these commands
in the upcoming weeks of the course.

A. Run with no modifications:
chmod a+x prepare.sh

B. Run after replacing <UVID> with your LUC universal
identification (https://www.luc.edu/its/uvidinformation/):
./prepare.sh <UVID>

Here is the command example for Prof. Moreira's UVID
for a reference:
./prepare.sh dmoreira1

These commands will create a directory named "comp141_assign2"
inside your $HOME directory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory).
Use the "ls" command to list the content of $HOME and look for it:
ls $HOME


3. Assignment Instructions
After successfully executing item 2 above, do the following tasks
by using the command line. Do not use a graphical user interface.

3.1. Change the working directory to "comp141_assign2".

3.2. Inspect the content of "comp141_assign2" by navigating
inside it. How many directories and subdirectories are there
within "comp141_assign2"? Write down the answer in a side note.

3.3. Continue inspecting the content of "comp141_assign2".
How many image files are there inside the directories and
subdirectories of "comp141_assign2"? Use a side note to
help you count the number of images. Tip: use the "file"
command to verify which files are indeed images.

3.4. Submit your answers to Sakai (https://sakai.luc.edu/x/u80AXl)
by using the "inline submission" of "Homework 2". Type in the
proper text box the following information:
* Line 1: your UVID.
* Line 2: the number of directories and subdirectories you've found
when doing task 3.2.
* Line 3: the number of images you've counted when doing task 3.3.

Here is the answer key example for Prof. Moreira's UVID
for a reference. Ignore the "--------------" lines:

If you answer items 3.2 and 3.3 correctly, you'll receive
5 points for each one.


Thanks for your attention with these exercises.
