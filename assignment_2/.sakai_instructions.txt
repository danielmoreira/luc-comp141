Hi everyone,

This is our second assignment.
Please follow the steps below to download the instructions to your Unix-like terminal.
You will need to work on the terminal to execute the instructions and obtain the answers, which you will then submit
here in the available text box.
Let me know if you face any issues or have any questions while doing it.

Cheers,
-- Daniel


1. Git Installation
You will need Git installed on your system to download the instructions and questions.
To test if Git is running on your system, execute the following command on your Unix-like terminal:

git --version

If you get a "command not found" error, install Git with one of the following commands.

For MacOS users:

brew install git

For WSL and Ubuntu (or another Debian-based distribution) users:

sudo apt install git

Make sure to provide the user's password in the latter case.
Observe that characters do not display when you type passwords.


2. Download the Instructions
Execute the following command on your terminal after Git is successfully installed:

git clone --depth=1 -b assignment_2 https://github.com/danielmoreira/luc-comp141.git luc-comp141-assign2

This command will create a folder named "luc-comp141-assign2" in the current working directory.
Verify if the folder was created by running:

ls luc-comp141-assign2



3. Open and Follow the Instructions
Change the working directory to the folder "luc-comp141-assign2/assignment_2":

cd luc-comp141-assign2/assignment_2

Read the content of the file named "instructions.txt" and follow the instructions carefully.
To read the file content, you can use the "less" command:

less instructions.txt

Use the keyboard arrows up and down to navigate the file content and press "q" to quit.
