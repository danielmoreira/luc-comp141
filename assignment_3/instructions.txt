1. Introduction
This document contains the instructions to answer
the third assignment of the COMP 141 / 400D course.
This assignment aims to train and evaluate the students'
abilities to manipulate files and directories in a
Unix-like file system, and redirect the output of one
command to another.


2. File System Preparation
If you are reading these instructions, it means you have
successfully executed the "git" command to clone the
"assignment_3" branch of the project hosted at
"https://github.com/danielmoreira/luc-comp141" to your
local Unix-like system. FYI, we will learn Git toward the
end of the course.

It also means you have found the cloned directory named
"assignment_3" within your file system. Make sure to have
it set as your current working directory by using the
"change directory" (cd) command to reach it. Use the
"print working directory" (pwd) command to confirm this
information.

Once inside the "assignment_3" directory, run the following
sequence of commands to prepare your file system for the
assignment. FYI, we will learn the meaning of these commands
in the upcoming weeks of the course.

A. Run with no modifications:
chmod a+x install.sh

B. Run after replacing <UVID> with your LUC universal
identification (https://www.luc.edu/its/uvidinformation/):
./install.sh <UVID>

Here is the command example for Prof. Moreira's UVID
for a reference:
./install.sh dmoreira1

These commands will create a directory named "comp141_assign3"
inside your $HOME directory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory).
Use the "ls" command to list the content of $HOME and look for it:
ls $HOME


3. Assignment Instructions
After successfully executing item 2 above, do the following tasks
by using the command line. Do not use a graphical user interface.

3.1. Change the working directory to "comp141_assign3".

3.2. Inspect the content of "comp141_assign3" by navigating
inside it with "cd" and calling other commands. How many JPG image
files are there inside the directories and subdirectories of
"comp141_assign3"? Do not count them by hand, as it would take too long.
Use a combination of the "ls" and "wc" commands with I/O redirection,
instead.

3.3. Create, inside "comp141_assign3", the following directory structure,
in addition to the existing "images" folder:
comp141_assign3
 ├── train
 ├── test
 └── validation

3.4. Move all the JPG files whose names contain the "train" string
from the "images" to the "train" directory. How many JPG images
are there inside the "train" folder after you moved the files?

3.5. Move all the JPG files whose names contain the "valid" string
from the "images" to the "validation" directory. How many JPG images
are there inside the "validation" folder after you moved the files?

3.6. Move all the JPG files whose names contain the "test" string
from the "images" to the "test" directory. How many JPG images
are there inside the "test" folder after you moved the files?

3.7. List the images of the "train" directory sorted by disk size
from the smallest to the largest and save the result in a text file
named "comp141_assign3/train_list.txt". Use the "long" and
"human-readable" options to list the images.

3.8. List the images of the "validation" directory sorted by disk
size from the smallest to the largest and save the result in a text
file named "comp141_assign3/valid_list.txt". Use the "long" and
"human-readable" options to list the images.

3.9. List the images of the "test" directory sorted by disk size
from the smallest to the largest and save the result in a text file
named "comp141_assign3/test_list.txt". Use the "long" and
"human-readable" options to list the images.

3.10. Remove the "images" folder completely and save the output of the
"tree" command inside a text file name "comp141_assign3/tree.txt".

3.11. Submit your answers to Sakai (https://sakai.luc.edu/x/u80AXl)
by using the available text box and the "Attachments" feature of "Homework 3".
Type in the text box the following information:
* Line 1: your UVID.
* Line 2: the number of images counted in item 3.2.
* Line 3: the number of images moved in item 3.4.
* Line 4: the number of images moved in item 3.5.
* Line 5: the number of images moved in item 3.6.

Moreover, attach the following files:
* File "train_list.txt" generated in item 3.7.
* File "valid_list.txt" generated in item 3.8.
* File "test_list.txt" generated in item 3.9.
* File "tree.txt" generated in item 3.10.

If you answer item 3.2 correctly, your will receive 1 point for it.
If you answer items 3.4-3.10 correctly, you will receive 2 points for each one.
The total of points is 15.
