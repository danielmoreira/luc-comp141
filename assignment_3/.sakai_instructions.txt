Hi everyone,

This is our third assignment.
Please follow the steps below to download the instructions to your Unix-like terminal.
You will need to work on the terminal to execute the instructions, obtain the answers, and generate the output files.
You will then submit your answers here by using the available text box and attaching the requested output files with the "Attachments" feature.
Let me know if you face any issues or have any questions while doing it.

Cheers,
-- Daniel


1. Download the Instructions
Execute the following command on your terminal. Make sure Git was previously installed (see Homework #2):

git clone --depth=1 -b assignment_3 https://github.com/danielmoreira/luc-comp141.git luc-comp141-assign3

This command will create a folder named "luc-comp141-assign3" in the current working directory.
Verify if the folder was created by running:

ls luc-comp141-assign3



2. Open and Follow the Instructions
Change the working directory to the folder "luc-comp141-assign3/assignment_3":

cd luc-comp141-assign3/assignment_3

Read the content of the file named "instructions.txt" and follow the instructions carefully.
To read the file content, you can use the "less" command:

less instructions.txt

Use the keyboard arrows up and down to navigate the file content and press "q" to quit.
