COMP 141 / 400D - Intro to Computing Tools and Techniques
Loyola University Chicago, Fall 2024
Assignment #5: Using vi
Total: 10 points
Due date: Nov 10, 11:55 PM CT

1. Introduction
This document contains the instructions to answer
the fifth assignment of the COMP 141 / 400D course.
This assignment aims to train and evaluate the students'
abilities to use vi to manipulate large text files.


2. File System Preparation
If you are reading these instructions, it means you have
successfully executed the "git" command to clone the
"assignment_5" branch of the project hosted at
"https://github.com/danielmoreira/luc-comp141" to your
local Unix-like system. FYI, we will learn Git toward the
end of the course.

It also means you have found the cloned directory named
"assignment_5" within your file system. Make sure to have
it set as your current working directory by using the
"change directory" (cd) command to reach it. Use the
"print working directory" (pwd) command to confirm this
information.

Once inside the "assignment_5" directory, run the following
sequence of commands to prepare your file system for the
assignment.

A. Make the "prepare" script executable. Run with no modifications:
chmod a+x prepare.sh

B. Run with no modifications:
./prepare.sh

These commands will create a directory named "comp141_assign5"
inside your $HOME directory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory).
Use the "ls" command to list the content of $HOME and look for it:
ls $HOME


3. Assignment Instructions
After successfully executing item 2 above, do the following tasks
by using vi and the command line. Do not use a graphical user interface.

3.1. Change the working directory to "comp141_assign5".

3.2. Check the content of the directory. You must find the following text files:
* File 1: profiles_2015.csv (with 10,379 lines)
* File 2: profiles_2023.csv (with 32,114 lines)

3.3. Verify the number of lines within each file, to make sure you have got
non-corrupted versions.

3.4. Open both files and a new third one named 'profiles_2024.csv' with vi.

3.5. Transfer the header of "File 2" to the new file.
The header comprises the first lines of the file that start with a "#".

3.6. In addition to the header, merge the content of "File 1" and "File 2" into the new file:

3.6.1. Add the content of "File 1" first without its first two lines.
Replace every '|' delimiter with ','.

Here is an example of a modified line after replacement:
Original:
1|/home/comp141/profile_system/pictures/077454.png|Knox Zev|2012/10/17|1988/9/5|Chicago|India|167|94|Pilot

1,/home/comp141/profile_system/pictures/077454.png,Knox Zev,2012/10/17,1988/9/5,Chicago,India,167,94,Pilot

3.6.2. Append the content of "File 2", after removing its lines 10,001 -- 13,000.
Do not repeat its header.

3.7. Replace the fixed home directory "/home/comp141" with the following string: "$HOME".
Here is an example of a line after replacement:
Original:
1,/home/comp141/profile_system/pictures/077454.png,Knox Zev,2012/10/17,1988/9/5,Chicago,India,167,94,Pilot
Modified:
1,$HOME/profile_system/pictures/077454.png,Knox Zev,2012/10/17,1988/9/5,Chicago,India,167,94,Pilot

3.8. Remove all the lines in the new file that have one or more "none" values.


Save the new file and upload it to Sakai.
You will get up to 10 points if you accomplish the following tasks:
* 2 points for doing item 3.5 correctly.
* 2 points for doing item 3.6.1 correctly.
* 2 points for doing item 3.6.2 correctly.
* 2 points for doing item 3.7 correctly.
* 2 points for doing item 3.8 correctly.

Thanks for your attention with these exercises.
This is the end of the instructions file.
