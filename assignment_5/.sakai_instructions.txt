Hi everyone,

This is our fifth assignment.
Please follow the steps below to download the instructions to your Unix-like terminal.
You will need to work on the terminal with vi to execute the instructions and generate the expected file, which you will upload here as an attachment.
Let me know if you face any issues or have any questions while doing it.

Cheers,
-- Daniel


1. Download the Instructions
Execute the following command on your terminal. Make sure Git was previously installed (see Homework #2):

git clone -b assignment_5 https://github.com/danielmoreira/luc-comp141.git luc-comp141-assign5

This command will create a folder named "luc-comp141-assign5" in the current working directory.
Verify if the folder was created by running:

ls luc-comp141-assign5


2. Open and Follow the Instructions
Change the working directory to the folder "luc-comp141-assign5/assignment_5":

cd luc-comp141-assign5/assignment_5

Read the content of the file named "instructions.txt" and follow the instructions carefully.
To read the file content, you can use the "less" command:

less instructions.txt

Use the keyboard arrows up and down to navigate the file content and press "q" to quit.
