Hi everyone,

This is our fourth assignment.
Please follow the steps below to download the instructions to your Unix-like terminal.
You will need to work on the terminal to execute the instructions and obtain the answers, which you will then submit here in the available text box.
Let me know if you face any issues or have any questions while doing it.

Cheers,
-- Daniel


1. Download the Instructions
Execute the following command on your terminal. Make sure Git was previously installed (see Homework #2):

git clone -b assignment_4 https://github.com/danielmoreira/luc-comp141.git luc-comp141-assign4

This command will create a folder named "luc-comp141-assign4" in the current working directory.
Verify if the folder was created by running:

ls luc-comp141-assign4



2. Open and Follow the Instructions
Change the working directory to the folder "luc-comp141-assign4/assignment_4":

cd luc-comp141-assign4/assignment_4

Read the content of the file named "instructions.txt" and follow the instructions carefully.
To read the file content, you can use the "less" command:

less instructions.txt

Use the keyboard arrows up and down to navigate the file content and press "q" to quit.
