1. Introduction
This document contains the instructions to answer
the fourth assignment of the COMP 141 / 400D course.
This assignment aims to train and evaluate the students'
abilities to kill a process and manage file permissions.


2. File System Preparation
If you are reading these instructions, it means you have
successfully executed the "git" command to clone the
"assignment_4" branch of the project hosted at
"https://github.com/danielmoreira/luc-comp141" to your
local Unix-like system. FYI, we will learn Git toward the
end of the course.

It also means you have found the cloned directory named
"assignment_4" within your file system. Make sure to have
it set as your current working directory by using the
"change directory" (cd) command to reach it. Use the
"print working directory" (pwd) command to confirm this
information.

Once inside the "assignment_4" directory, run the following
sequence of commands to prepare your file system for the
assignment.

A. Make the "prepare" script executable. Run with no modifications:
chmod a+x prepare.sh

B. Run with no modifications:
./prepare.sh

These commands will create a directory named "comp141_assign4"
inside your $HOME directory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory).
Use the "ls" command to list the content of $HOME and look for it:
ls $HOME


3. Assignment Instructions
After successfully executing item 2 above, do the following tasks
by using the command line. Do not use a graphical user interface.

3.1. Change the working directory to "comp141_assign4".

3.2. Change the permission of the script available as "vir.sh" to make it executable.

3.3. Run after replacing <UVID> with your LUC universal
identification (https://www.luc.edu/its/uvidinformation/):
./vir.sh <UVID>

Here is the command example for Prof. Moreira's UVID for a reference:
./vir.sh dmoreira1

3.4. Kill the process related to the execution of the "vir.sh" script.
You will have 5 minutes to discover its Process ID (PID)  with "ps" or "top" and kill it.
If you do not kill it within the 5 minutes, you will fail the assignment;
if that's the case, go back to item 3.3 above and retry it.
ATTENTION: closing the terminal window with the "X" button WILL NOT kill the program.
You will fail the assignment if you do it.

3.5. Check the content of the file saved as "code.txt" within the current directory.
Make sure you have the permission to read it.
ATTENTION: there will be no "code.txt" file if you failed to kill the process in item 3.4.

3.6. Submit your answer to Sakai (https://sakai.luc.edu/x/u80AXl)
by using the available text box. Type in the text box the following information:
* Line 1: your UVID.
* Line 2: the content of the "code.txt" file, related to item 3.5.

Here is the answer key example for Prof. Moreira's UVID
for a reference. Ignore the "--------------" lines:
--------------
dmoreira1
900
--------------

If you answer item 3.6 correctly, your will receive 10 points for the assignment.
