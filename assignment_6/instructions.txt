1. Introduction
This document contains the instructions to answer
the sixth assignment of the COMP 141 / 400D course.
This assignment aims to train and evaluate the students'
abilities to access a remote server, and compress, archive,
and transfer data from the local host to the server and
vice-versa.


2. Local File System Preparation
If you are reading these instructions, it means you have
successfully executed the "git" command to clone the
"assignment_6" branch of the project hosted at
"https://github.com/danielmoreira/luc-comp141" to your
local Unix-like system. FYI, we will learn Git toward the
end of the course.

It also means you have found the cloned directory named
"assignment_6" within your local file system. Make sure to
have it set as your current working directory by using the
"change directory" (cd) command to reach it. Use the
"print working directory" (pwd) command to confirm this
information.

Once inside the "assignment_6" directory, run the following
sequence of commands to prepare your file system for the
assignment. Please notice "user@local$" will actually
be the prompt in your local terminal; you will have to
execute the commands provided after it.

A. Make the "prepare" script executable. Run the command below
with no modifications:
user@local$ chmod a+x prepare.sh

B. Run with no modifications:
user@local$ ./prepare.sh

These commands will create a directory named "comp141_assign6"
inside your $HOME directory. Use the "ls" command to list the content of
$HOME and look for it:
user@local$ ls $HOME


3. Remote Server Access Preparation
The name of the remote server we will use is:
jhub.cs.luc.edu

A user account was created for each student in the remote server.
Your credentials should be the following, after replacing <UVID>
with your LUC universal identification (https://www.luc.edu/its/uvidinformation/):
User: <UVID>
PW: <UVID>@luc.edu

A. Verify if your local terminal can reach the remote server.
Use the "ping" command to contact the server by using its name:
user@local$ ping jhub.cs.luc.edu

Make sure the server is responding; stop the command with "CTRL+c".
You should see how many data packets were transmitted to and how many
were received by the server.

ATTENTION: if no data packets were received, please contact the
instructor and TAs right away. You will need Internet connection to
answer this assignment. If you are not connected through the "LUC" network,
log in to the GlobalProtect application following the steps described at
https://www.luc.edu/its/informationsecurity/resources/loyolasecureaccess/globalprotect.

B. Configure your access to the server with a Secure Shell (SSH) key.
B.1. In your local Unix-like terminal, create a pair of SSH keys with the
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which is one of the
best solutions for encrypting data keys, including remote server
access keys. To do it, use the "ssh-keygen" command with the "-t ecdsa"
type option:
user@local$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa

Press the [ENTER] return key with empty values for all the interactive
questions (e.g., standard file name to save the generated keys, and empty
passphrase).

B.2. Transfer the generated public key (stored at "~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub")
to the remote server with the "ssh-copy-id" command. Run after replacing
<UVID>:
user@local$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub <UVID>@jhub.cs.luc.edu

Provide your password (detailed in the credentials above) when requested.

C. Access the remote server with SSH by running the following command after
replacing <UVID>:
user@local$ ssh <UVID>@jhub.cs.luc.edu

You should see the prompt change to "<UVID>@jhub~$" without typing your
password.

D. Change your default password in the server for security reasons.
Use the "passwd" command and follow the interactive instructions:
<UVID>@jhub~$ passwd

E. Close the connection with the remote server; use the exit command:
<UVID>@jhub~$ exit


4. Assignment Instructions
After successfully executing items 2 and 3 above, do the following tasks
by using the command line. Do not use a graphical user interface.

4.1. Change the local working directory to "~/comp141_assign6".

4.2. Transfer the script file named "data_gen.sh" to the remote server.

4.3. Access the script in the server and run it remotely.
Make sure the script file has the correct permissions.
After running the script, a folder will be generated at
"~/assign6_output"; make sure you find it in the server file system.

4.4. Archive and compress the content of the generated "~/assign6_output"
folder by combining the "tar" and "gzip" commands.

4.5. Transfer the compressed and archived file back to your local machine.
Upload it to Sakai.


You will get up to 10 points if you accomplish the following tasks:
* 2.5 points for accomplishing item 4.2;
* 2.5 points for accomplishing item 4.3;
* 2.5 points for accomplishing item 4.4;
* 2.5 points for accomplishing item 4.5.


Thanks for your attention with these exercises.
This is the end of the instructions file.
